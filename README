## This is a project on image analysis of the 1001g ##
# If I make to work git, this will be the place with all python script for image processing and analysis #

There are several scripts connected through the pipeline script. The steps are:
### Scheme of pipeline ###
# read all images in a directory
	#Â get the date of the file
	# load the index of the trays
# crop and save all pot images with the date, original image name and coordinates of pot
	# number of images is 49trays * 40pots * 20timepictures = 39200 pictures to analyze, then better to parallelize
# segment all images
	# append in to a single file with photo number, date and location
